Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** 
  1. Complete Pytorch tutorial
  2. Read the project paper 
  3. Run the RetinaVision code
  4. Read Sumitha's paper
* **Week 2** 
  1. Run Samuel's pipeline
  2. Read up on Autoencoders
  3. Read Alvaro and George's papers
  4. lLook into Neural Net compression
* **Week 3** 
  1. Look into the different types of Autoencoders
  2. build a simple Autoencoder using Alvaro's dataset
  3. Look into Variational Autoencoders
* **Week 4**
  1. Find a working Convolutional Autoencoder on Github
  2. Run the Autoencoder and look at different ways to optimise it (i.e. Torchsnoop, Tensorboard)
  3. Try running the Autoencoder using Alvaro's cortical images
  4. Maybe look into inverting cortical images back to normal
